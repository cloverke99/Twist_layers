# Twist_layers

This code generate configurations for twisted bilayer TMDs and graphene.
We follow closely the approach presented in PHYSICAL REVIEW B 90, 155451 (2014)
use case: twisted bilayer graphene, bilayer TMD, TMD on hBN substrate ...

# Heterostructure

For heterostructures, we write different set of n and m for the two layers and search for the smallest positive integers
that gives the specified angle and has strain less than the user specified threshold.
